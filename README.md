# RestDemo
# Simple application to demonstrate rest endpoints with controllers
# REST stands for representational state transfer and was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding.
# Stateless means the state of the service doesn't persist between subsequent requests and response. It means that the request itself contains the state required to handle the request. It can be a query-string parameter, entity, or header as a part of the URI.
